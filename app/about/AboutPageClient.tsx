      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 600, marginTop: 32, marginBottom: 8 }}>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        You answer a short series of questions about how you sleep. Our scoring engine then evaluates every product in our
        catalogue against your answers - weighing the factors that matter most to you - and surfaces your top matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommendations are generated in real time, entirely in your browser. We do not store your answers on any server.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 600, marginTop: 32, marginBottom: 8 }}>How scoring stays independent</h2>
      <p>
        Product ranking is driven by fit score only (sleep position, firmness, fill type, cooling, and your priorities).
        Commission status does not change score order.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 600, marginTop: 32, marginBottom: 8 }}>Our catalogue</h2>
      <p>
        We cover pillows across all sleep types - from side sleepers to back sleepers, budget to premium. Products are
        selected based on availability, verified specifications, and breadth of coverage across different sleep needs.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 600, marginTop: 32, marginBottom: 8 }}>Affiliate disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click through and make a purchase, we may earn a small
        commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us keep the tool free and independent.
      </p>
      {amazonDisclosure ? <p>{amazonDisclosure}</p> : null}
      <p>Our recommendations are driven by the scoring algorithm - not by commission rates or sponsorship.</p>
      <p>
        Prices and availability are set by retailers, not by us, and may change at any time. Always confirm the latest
        product details, delivery terms, and return policy on the retailer&apos;s site before purchasing.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, fontWeight: 600, marginTop: 32, marginBottom: 8 }}>Who&rsquo;s behind this</h2>
      <p>
        FindYourIdealPillow was built to cut through the noise of pillow marketing and give people a straightforward,
        honest recommendation based on how they actually sleep — nothing to buy, sign up for, or sit through.
